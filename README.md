Highlights of the Implementation

•	MVVM with Clean Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns and a scalable, testable structure.
•	State Management: Properly handles UI states (Loading, Success, Error) for better user experience and maintainability.
•	Coroutines & Flow: Used for asynchronous and reactive programming, enabling structured concurrency and cleaner data flow—used as an alternative to RxJava.
•	Retrofit: Used for network communication to fetch data from the Open Library API.
•	Coil: Lightweight and fast image loading library used to display book covers.
•	ModalBottomSheet: Displays book details in a modern and interactive way upon item selection.
•	Hilt: Simplifies dependency injection and improves modularity.
•	Jetpack Compose: Used for building a modern, declarative UI.
